- Flask-Paginate,
- Python-usernames,
- SQLite3.
and others.

Following are utilized in a project:

The project itself is something like an extensible monolithic base for a simple social network.
Strongly recommended to rewrite SQLite3 DB queries with an ORM like SQLAlchemy in a pair with MySQL or PostgreSQL or any other strong DMS in opposite of SQLite due to unfinished state of the project.
